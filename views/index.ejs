          <p>Hundreds of students travel home every weekend, yet students find it hard to get packages from their home without high shipping costs and long delivery times. 
            Sent is creating a platform that connects students going home with students wanting packages from home. Students receiving packages pay less than traditional shipping options, 
            and students carrying packages earn by monetizing the empty space in their travel bags: a platform for students, by students.
